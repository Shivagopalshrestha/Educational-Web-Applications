# Educational-Web-Applications

# Introduction
I have been recently working on learning about web development. As a means for practicing my newly aquired JavaScript skills, I will be building web applications for teaching concepts in statistics. 

From my experience I have found it difficult to teach concepts such as central limit theorem and monte carlo simulations. I believe the main difficulty for students is not being able to visualize these more difficult concepts. So I am hoping these interactive web applications can be used as a supplement to help understand difficult topics in statistics. 

# Testing the web apps
The web apps will be available [here](http://shaikhhammad.com/Educational-Web-Applications/). Feel free to play around with them and test them on multiple devices and browsers.

# Contributing
Feel free to raise issues and also contribute ideas on what web applications will be effective in teaching certain statistics concepts. Currently I am just aiming for the apps to work on standard laptop and desktop screens, implementing compatability onto tablets and mobile devices would be a great contribution.
